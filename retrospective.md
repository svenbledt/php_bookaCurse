# Retrospective

## Final thoughts
---
* A great project to try out various skills.
* I used Miro instead of figam, not sure if I stay with Miro or Figma. Miro is rathern intuitive, but not web dev specific as Figma is when used correctly
* => get mor info still on Figam (and Miro)
* basic planing ok, but suddenly rather caotic...
* while my horror part, the Javascript form itself wasnt that hard, the finalizing of style was a little bit stormy...
* => better planing, clearer layout basic from start, work much mor sytematically

## Knowldgebase
* under construction, have to clean my collected links throughout this project and put them in my personal library with clear description and labels.

In my project i offer two possinbel language classes, "Klingon" or "Elvespeak" (we are called "Stranger Tounges (tm) not for naught...
